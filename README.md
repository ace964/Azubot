Introduction

The Azubot is a ImagingHub project. See: http://imaginghub.com/projects/192-azubot

The Azubot is a robot, which is movable through a chain drive. 
It has cameras mounted to a movable head, as well as visible light and infrared light LEDs. 
The brain of our project is a Raspberry Pi (version 3) with a specially designed shield mounted on top of it. 
This shield controls the motors, switches the LEDs, sends signals to the servos (controlling the head of the robot) and provides a battery monitoring.
